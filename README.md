# Sorting Searching Library In C Language

A library containing various searching and sorting functions to search and sort a list according to the given comparator function.

## SORTING
**Sorting** is a process of ordering individual elements of a list according to their proper rank, either in ascending or descending order.<br>
* A programming logic with few steps which can sort a bunch of elements are called sorting algorithms.<br>
* There are different types of sorting algorithms like<br>
   * **Bubble Sort** - A sorting algorithm which compares one element to its next element and if requires it swaps like a bubble.<br>
   * **Selection Sort** - A sorting algorithm which selects a position in the elements and compares it to the rest of the positions one by one.<br>
   * **Insertion Sort** - A sorting algorithm which selects one element from the array and is compared to the one side of the array. Element is inserted to the proper position while shifting others.<br>
   * **Merge Sort** - A sorting algorithm which divides the elements to subgroups and then merges back to make a sorted.<br>
   * **Quick Sort** - A sorting algorithm which divides the elements into two subsets and again sorts recursively.<br>
